# nvim-surround

Stdiv - wrap selected text in visual mode with div

cst - change tag

# find and replace occurrence after

Breakdown:

- `\*`: start a search for the word under the cursor (g\* if you donâ€™t want the word boundaries)
- `c`: change
- `gn`: the next match

So you put your cursor somewhere in a word, press \*cgn, type the replacement,
hit <esc>, and then hit `.` to change the next occurrence.

If you already searched for the word, ignore the \* and just cgn.
