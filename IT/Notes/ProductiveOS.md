# Ideas for the productivity in OS (design for desktop environment)

- Sidebar with master search
- Minimalistic interface with all settings and options enclosed in one master search side menu
- Different symbols mean search in different places
- Button to select places where to search (for simple users)
- Plugins in the separate side menu (card menu) with miniature apps heat buttons (e.g discord mute unmute, spotify play, notion, clock, calendar, chatgpt, telegram, etc.)
- Nix inspired single file for all plugins backup on change
- (whole system probably fedora or nix based)
- Desktop spaces
- Script visual editor with nodes like in unreal engine
- Frequently used options like wifi, bluetooth, sound, night light, mobile hot spot etc.
- Integrated calendar with selected account
- Based configuration sync with cloud (with selective package syncing)
- File converter everything to everything in sidebar master search
- AI summarizer, translator.
- Custom model for AI from internet.
