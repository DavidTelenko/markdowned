## Hard Skills

- **C++** 
    - **General**: deep understanding and knowledge of general concepts of C++ language.
    - **Standard library**: use of right tool, data structures and algorithms (`std::ranges`, `std::pmr`, `std::optional`, smart pointers, data structures).
    - **Newer stuff**: C++ 20 concepts and template metaprogramming, C++ 23 standard library features.
    - **Multithreading and asynchronous programming**: `co_await`, `std::mutex`, `std::thread`.
    - **Core language idioms**: SFINAE, RAII, RTTI, IIFE, CTAD, CRTP, Pimpl, move semantic, Copy-Swap or the Rule of Zero / Three / Five.
    - **Functional programming idioms**: monad, monoid, functor.
    - **Object oriented principles**: SOLID, abstraction, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, gang of four design patterns.
    - **Memory management**: dynamic allocation, allocators, memory arenas, `std::pmr`.
    - **Optimization techniques**: huge advocate for using template metaprogramming and
      higher order monadic wrappers instead of OOP and exceptions. Memory layout, SOA, AOS.
    - **Libraries**: `fmt`, `boost`, `gtest`, `ranges`, `gRPC`.
    - **Code**: library quality code standards, camel case enjoyer.

- **Tooling**
    - **Build Systems**: `Cmake`, `Cpack`, `Ctest`, `ninja`, `makefile`.
    - **Package Managers**: `vcpkg`, `conan`.
    - **General**: understanding and ability to learn, best practices.

- **Other skills**
    - **Knowledge in scripting languages**: `python`, `js`, `lua`, `bash`, `nushell`
    - **Human readable data serialization languages**: `toml`, `yaml`, `json`, `xml`, `csv`.
    - **Linux**: Understanding of Linux core utilities.
    - **Ability to work from terminal**.
    - **Editor**: Vim (Neovim) generally, VS Code if necessary, Visual Studio if tooling is required.
    - **Soft**: debugging, profiling, sanitizing. (`gdb`, `valgrind`)

## Soft Skills

- **Core**
    - Not conflicting or toxic.
    - Pair / Team programming lover.
    - Hard working and perfection oriented.
    - Creative and out of the box thinking.
    - Analysis and critical thinking.
    - Constant learning and ability to accept and correct mistakes.

- **Languages**
    - **Ukrainian**: C2, (native language)
    - **English**: B2, (good speaking and writing skills)
