# Seek and Run game idea

You are followed by a monster of some sort and the main target is to survive but never stay in the same place for the long time. Similar to challenge in The Long Dark but a bit more involved and interesting with more game mechanics around protecting from monster, resource management and coop.

# Simple RPG Game

- There are three main biomes: desert, frozen biome, and forest.
- Between them, there are transitional biomes: taiga, ocean, dried-up sea,
  swamp, etc. These are smaller.
- You spawn randomly in one of them. You can play in co-op or PvP mode. In
  co-op, you either spawn together or in different main biomes.
- There are three classes: warrior, mage, bandit.
- Between these classes, there are hybrid classes: paladin, illusionist,
  berserker.
- Each class has mechanics corresponding to the biome where you spawned: in the
  frozen biome, the warrior is a barbarian, the mage uses ice, in the desert
  there's a fireball-throwing guy, a golden warrior, etc.
- Each of the three biomes has a boss: dragon, golem, dendroid.
- When playing solo in the desert, for example, your goal is to defeat the
  dendroid from the forest.
- In co-op mode, your goal is the same as in solo, but it's more challenging.
- In PvP mode, the goal is to defeat players from other biomes.

# Typing / CLI game

- You have two parts of the screen one of which is exclusively dedicated to writing commands.
- Commands by itself can be either some IRL language or DSL, subject to evolve.
- On the left there's a wider screen with cells in it, there you see results of your actions and some strategy evolving.
- In most basic sense on the left there's a cell grid where some buildings can be placed and some actions can be executed via commands.
- Commands by itself takes e.g cell coordinate which is written on the left, and you can use different ones to select and place certain structures or perform actions.
