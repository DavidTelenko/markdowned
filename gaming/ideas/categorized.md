# Seek and Run game idea

You are followed by a monster of some sort and the main target is to survive but never stay in the same place for the long time. Similar to challenge in The Long Dark but a bit more involved and interesting with more game mechanics around protecting from monster, resource management and coop.

# Typing / CLI game

- You have two parts of the screen one of which is exclusively dedicated to writing commands.
- Commands by itself can be either some IRL language or DSL, subject to evolve.
- On the left there's a wider screen with cells in it, there you see results of your actions and some strategy evolving.
- In most basic sense on the left there's a cell grid where some buildings can be placed and some actions can be executed via commands.
- Commands by itself takes e.g cell coordinate which is written on the left, and you can use different ones to select and place certain structures or perform actions.
