# Genshin TODO

List of tasks to submit to genshin survey.

- [ ] An ability to select which theme to use, there's both dark and white loading screens in game, but they alternate randomly, add a single switch in settings to select one particular.
- [ ] An ability to use Radiant Spincrystals without going to tea pot
- [ ] Not only show an amount of collected item, but also the amount of currently possessed ones. So for example if you collect one flower it will show +1 and 32 total in inventory.
- [ ] An ability to skip filler dialogues. For example from resents there was several chill parties, and other minor chit-chat in Natlan archon quests, it could be skipped right to action, which means you need to only set some time points in configuration that indicates them and be able to skip through.
- [ ] Notifications for Parametric Transformer. When it's done exclamation mark could be shown on inventory.
- [ ] Bank of boss drops, meaning if I don't want to farm currently present bosses in the world, and want to wait for a newer boss, I can collect up to certain amount of tries and then use them whenever the new boss comes out. It would greatly increase satisfaction of playing a newly added character with new boss materials for talents, and also give an ability to spend more resin.
- [ ] More locations with artifacts in game. Just like with Obsidian fragments. Maybe add some guaranteed afixes for this kind of artifacts.
- [ ] Permanent hide'n'seek mini game.
- [ ] Make restart button for a Crystalfly Trap, so that it would just place it in the same place with same materials as a fuel.
- [ ] Built into the game UI the browser feature (that renders web page). Instead make the changelog and character updates inside of the UI elements of the game itself. Also short GIFs/videos would be great for new players to understand how to play certain character.
