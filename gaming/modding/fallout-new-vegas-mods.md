# Absolutely Necessary if you want to play a stable game

 - [ ] [NVSE](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/58277) - A WHOLE LOT OF MODS REQUIRE THIS!!! GET IT NOW!!

 - [ ] [FNV 4GB](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/62552) - lets the game use more than 2GB of RAM.

 - [ ] [NVAC](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/53635) - New Vegas Anti-Crash. Does what it says on the box, but it doesn't fix all stability issues. That's why you need...

 - [ ] [New Vegas Stutter Remover](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34832) - Stuttering isn't just annoying, it can crash the game. This mod fixes that.

 - [ ] [CASM with MCM](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34832) - The vanilla autosaving system in FNV is broken and will eventualy casue your game to crash when you try and open a save. This doesn't just fix that, it enhances the savegame system too! To get the most benift you need to use it with...

 - [ ] [The Mod Configuration Menu (MCM)](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/42507). - Super-useful for those mods that it supports. Lets you config the mods via and in-game menu instead of from your desktop mod manager. Nifty!

# Not strictly essential but I consider them to be must-haves

 - [ ] [UIO](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/57174) - User Interface Organizer. - - Super-useful for customising your HUD, and more.

 - [ ] [MTUI](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/34902) - Used together with UIO and the MCM, it results in a much better user interface.

 - [ ] [OneHUD](https://www.nexusmods.com/newvegas/mods/44757) - For the trifecta of ultimate user interface perfection. Glorious.

 - [ ]  LevelUpNoLock - Essential if you want to remove the level lock.

 - [ ] Centered 3rd Person Camera - - Because the default over-the-shoulder view in 3rd person is just dumb.

 - [ ] Further 3rd person camera - Because I wanna zoom out more, dammit!

 - [ ] Inventory Sorter Combined - Sorts your stuff by type. Makes finding stuff in your inventory a ton easier.

 - [ ] NVEC - The base unofficial patch that you should probably use unless you're installing a total conversion.

 - [ ] NMC's Texture Pack (Large with 16:10 Main Screen). Because it's 2018 and my computer laughs at the system requirements of this game. Eye candy: ACTIVATE!

 - [ ] Weapon Mods Expanded (w/ Modern Weapons and WMX-DLC) - new ways to make your gun go pew pew, pew pew pew! Boom!!!!

# Personal favorites, your mileage may vary

 - [ ] Alternative repairing - new ways to repair stuff, and it's actually balanced!

 - [ ] Boones Silent Hunting Rifle - lets boone have a silencer for his rifle that still fires Magical Companion Ammo (you know, the kind that the companion never runs out of.

 - [ ] Boosted Skill Effects - does what it says on the box.

 - [ ] Bottle That Water - I have bottles, I have clean water sources, but the base game won't let me bottle said water!? This fixes that.

 - [ ] Bountiful Harvest - farming for food and profit just got easier

 - [ ] Easy Hacking - because I hate minigames.

 - [ ] Fellout (w/ greener grass) - ohhhhhh, pretty!

 - [ ] Goodsprings Home - home sweet home-shack.

 - [ ] Interior Lighting Overhaul - lamps now actually look like lamps.

 - [ ] Lutana's NVSE Plugin - useful for a mod... I forget which one.

 - [ ] Misc Item Icons - adds icons to misc items that lacked icons in the pipboy inventory

 - [ ] Perk per Level - Level cap at 100

 - [ ] The Someguy Series - Necessary if you want to play new vegas bounties

 - [ ] The New Bison Steve Hotel and Lucky Casino - quest mod.

 - [ ] New Vegas Bounties (I and II) - quest mods.

 - [ ] Wasteland Clothing Hires retexture (w/ Powderganger Fix) - eyecandy

 - [ ] Yukon Campaign Hunting Rifle (kinda OP but I love it)

 - [ ] Weapon and armor degradation decrease mod - call it a cheat if you will but I think the rate at which stuff breaks down is too fast. This fixes that. Your mileage may vary.

 - [ ] Universal Air Tank - immersion fix so you can wear helmets and clothing that fully covers your head and still wear/use the rebreather. Because you shouldn't have to choose between drowning and not being irradiated.
