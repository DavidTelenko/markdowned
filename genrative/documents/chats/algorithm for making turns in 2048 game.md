How to make left turn in 2048 game, provide me with algorithm in js

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

To make a left turn in the 2048 game, you need to shift all the tiles to the left and merge the tiles with the same value. Here's an algorithm in JavaScript:

1. Loop through each row of the game board from left to right.
2. For each row, loop through each tile from left to right.
3. If the current tile is empty, skip to the next tile.
4. If the current tile is not empty, find the farthest left tile that is empty and move the current tile to that position.
5. If the tile to the left of the current tile has the same value, merge the two tiles by adding their values and moving the merged tile to the farthest left empty position.
6. Repeat steps 3-5 for all tiles in the row.
7. Repeat steps 1-6 for all rows in the game board.

Here's the code for the algorithm:

```js
function moveLeft(board) {
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 1; j < board[i].length; j++) {
      if (board[i][j] !== 0) {
        let k = j - 1;
        while (k >= 0 && board[i][k] === 0) {
          k--;
        }
        if (k >= 0 && board[i][k] === board[i][j]) {
          board[i][k] *= 2;
          board[i][j] = 0;
        } else {
          board[i][k + 1] = board[i][j];
          board[i][j] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return board;
}
```

This function takes in a 2D array representing the game board and returns the board after the left turn has been made.

Write general algorithm for turn

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

Here's a general algorithm for making a turn in the 2048 game:

1. Determine the direction of the turn (left, right, up, or down).
2. Rotate the game board so that the tiles are oriented in a way that makes the turn direction equivalent to moving the tiles left.
3. Call the `moveLeft` function (or an equivalent function for the left direction) to shift and merge the tiles.
4. Rotate the game board back to its original orientation.
5. Return the updated game board.

Here's the code for the general algorithm:

```js
function makeTurn(board, direction) {
  switch (direction) {
    case 'left':
      // do nothing, already oriented left
      break;
    case 'right':
      board = rotateBoard(board, 180);
      break;
    case 'up':
      board = rotateBoard(board, -90);
      break;
    case 'down':
      board = rotateBoard(board, 90);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid direction');
  }
  board = moveLeft(board);
  switch (direction) {
    case 'left':
      // do nothing, already oriented left
      break;
    case 'right':
      board = rotateBoard(board, 180);
      break;
    case 'up':
      board = rotateBoard(board, 90);
      break;
    case 'down':
      board = rotateBoard(board, -90);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid direction');
  }
  return board;
}

function rotateBoard(board, angle) {
  // rotate the board by the given angle (in degrees)
  // returns a new 2D array representing the rotated board
  // implementation omitted for brevity
}
```

This function takes in a 2D array representing the game board and a string representing the direction of the turn ('left', 'right', 'up', or 'down'). It returns the updated game board after the turn has been made. The `rotateBoard` function is a helper function that rotates the game board by the given angle (in degrees).

Isn't it faster to write one function for each turn?

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

Yes, it can be faster to write separate functions for each turn direction instead of using a general algorithm that rotates the board. This is because each turn direction has its own unique logic for shifting and merging the tiles, and writing separate functions can make the code more readable and easier to maintain.

Here's an example of separate functions for each turn direction:

```js
function moveLeft(board) {
  // shift and merge tiles to the left
  // implementation omitted for brevity
}

function moveRight(board) {
  // shift and merge tiles to the right
  // implementation omitted for brevity
}

function moveUp(board) {
  // shift and merge tiles up
  // implementation omitted for brevity
}

function moveDown(board) {
  // shift and merge tiles down
  // implementation omitted for brevity
}
```

With separate functions for each turn direction, the `makeTurn` function can simply call the appropriate function based on the direction parameter:

```js
function makeTurn(board, direction) {
  switch (direction) {
    case 'left':
      board = moveLeft(board);
      break;
    case 'right':
      board = moveRight(board);
      break;
    case 'up':
      board = moveUp(board);
      break;
    case 'down':
      board = moveDown(board);
      break;
    default:
      throw new Error('Invalid direction');
  }
  return board;
}
```

This approach can make the code more modular and easier to understand, especially if you need to make changes or add new features to the game in the future.

My `board` stored as one dimensional array, rewrite `moveLeft` function using two to one dimensional index formula  

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

Sure, here's how you can rewrite the `moveLeft` function to work with a one-dimensional array instead of a 2D array:

```js
function moveLeft(board) {
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += 4) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < i + 4; j++) {
      if (board[j] !== 0) {
        let k = j - 1;
        while (k >= i && board[k] === 0) {
          k--;
        }
        if (k >= i && board[k] === board[j]) {
          board[k] *= 2;
          board[j] = 0;
        } else {
          board[k + 1] = board[j];
          board[j] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return board;
}
```

In this version of the function, we use a nested loop to iterate over each row of the board. The outer loop increments by 4 to skip to the start of each row, and the inner loop iterates over the tiles in the row.

To calculate the index of a tile in the one-dimensional array, we use the formula `i * 4 + j`, where `i` is the row index and `j` is the column index within the row.

The rest of the logic is the same as in the previous version of the function. We shift and merge the tiles to the left, and then return the updated board.

Note that this function assumes that the board is stored in row-major order, with the tiles in each row stored consecutively in the array. If your board is stored in column-major order, you'll need to adjust the loop indices and the index formula accordingly.

4 is not the only size i wanna support here `for (let j = i + 1; j < i + 4; j++) {` you use this as a magic number

<hr class="__chatgpt_plugin">

role::assistant

You're right, using the number `4` as a magic number limits the function to only work with boards that have a width of 4. To support boards of different sizes, we can calculate the width of the board based on the length of the `board` array.

Here's an updated version of the `moveLeft` function that works with boards of any width:

```js
function moveLeft(board) {
  const width = Math.sqrt(board.length);
  for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i += width) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < i + width; j++) {
      if (board[j] !== 0) {
        let k = j - 1;
        while (k >= i && board[k] === 0) {
          k--;
        }
        if (k >= i && board[k] === board[j]) {
          board[k] *= 2;
          board[j] = 0;
        } else {
          board[k + 1] = board[j];
          board[j] = 0;
        }
      }
    }
  }
  return board;
}
```

In this version of the function, we calculate the width of the board by taking the square root of the length of the `board` array. This assumes that the board is a square, with the same number of rows and columns.

We then use the `width` variable to determine the start and end indices for each row, and to calculate the index of each tile in the one-dimensional array.

With this change, the `moveLeft` function should now work with boards of any width.
