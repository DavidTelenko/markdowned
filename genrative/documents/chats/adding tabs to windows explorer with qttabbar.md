Yes, QtTabBar is a third-party software that allows you to add tabs to the default Windows Explorer. It enhances the functionality of Windows Explorer by providing a tabbed interface, similar to web browsers, allowing you to open multiple folders or locations within a single window.

With QtTabBar, you can easily switch between different tabs, drag and drop tabs to rearrange them, and even group related tabs together. It also provides various customization options, such as changing the tab appearance, adding custom buttons, and configuring keyboard shortcuts.

QtTabBar is compatible with Windows 7, 8, and 10, and it integrates seamlessly with the default Windows Explorer interface. It is a popular choice for users who want to enhance their file browsing experience by adding tabbed functionality to Windows Explorer.

I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the option to change the background color of the tab bar is not available in the current version of QtTabBar. The information I provided earlier may not be accurate.

QtTabBar primarily focuses on providing tabbed functionality to Windows Explorer and may not offer extensive customization options for the appearance of the tab bar itself, including changing the background color.

If you specifically need to change the background color of the tab bar, you may need to explore alternative solutions or consider using other software or extensions that provide more customization options for the Windows Explorer interface.
