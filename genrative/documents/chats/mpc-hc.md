MPC-HC (Media Player Classic - Home Cinema) uses a combination of technologies to create its interface. The main components used are:

1. Win32 API: MPC-HC is primarily built using the Win32 API (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of functions and messages provided by Microsoft for creating Windows applications. It allows developers to create windows, handle user input, and manage various aspects of the application's interface.

2. DirectShow: MPC-HC utilizes the DirectShow framework, which is a multimedia framework provided by Microsoft. DirectShow enables MPC-HC to handle various media formats and codecs, allowing playback of audio and video files.

3. Custom UI Controls: MPC-HC also includes custom user interface controls that are specifically designed for media playback. These controls provide features like play, pause, seek, volume control, and various playback options.

4. Skin Support: MPC-HC supports skinning, which allows users to customize the appearance of the interface. Skins are created using XML-based files that define the layout and visual elements of the interface.

Overall, MPC-HC combines the Win32 API, DirectShow, custom UI controls, and skin support to create its user interface.
