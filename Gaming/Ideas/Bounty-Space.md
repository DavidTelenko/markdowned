# General ideas on game

Here I try to describe my bundled ideas about the game I have in mind, and general ideas that aims to make it unique and interesting)

## General setting and atmosphere

Lonely deserted planet. Two suns in the sky. Hot, dunes and sand. World is full of naturally occurring disasters: tornadoes, sand storms. Several small western-like towns, which gives sense of loneliness and abandonment. Two-five large cyberpunk cities that concentrate all civilization in planet. Rich trading and economic system. Clear distinction in resource supply and demand. Outlaws bands and rich multileveled crime-world. Setting generally can be described as mixture between Mad Max, Fallout, Dune, Cyberpunk, Red Dead Redemption, Mandalorian series. We take desert from Duna and Mad Max, large cities similar to what Cyberpunk and Fallout have spice it up with villages similar to Red Dead Redemption but in more cyber fashion like in Mandalorian series.

## Main character

You play as a lonely bounty hunter, you seek, plan and capture criminals. You have basic needs similar to what The Long Dark has but it's easier to maintain and control the levels because of longer timings. You are not completely human with modified parts but you tend to stay humane enough to not cause the Ship of Perseus dilemma. You are a real person not an empty shell with silent dialogue options (similar to Witcher). You have several robots helpers and you can play as them (More of a gameplay feature). Your story lies rather on a trivial more simple side of narrative. You are generated human, after the second riot for the rights of intellectual creatures, human generation continued but with more humane rules and freedoms. Still the attitude of originals and the general public opinions causes a lot of conflicts and misunderstandings. You set yourself a target to earn a right to be accepted in society and do good. You tend to shaken this opinion quite often.

Conceptually this character is similar to Witcher and Mandalorian. Some unique features would probably include less power and abilities with more thought process and planning. You are not the most capable nor talented however you have a lot of experience and knowledge. You a free to choose your own path and do completely different from an archetype initially built into the character. You can became merchant and earn money, you can became criminal, rob and kill, you can integrate into society of a big cities, you can live solitary life.

## Gameplay

### General

The gameplay is basically split between visual narrative and tactics / planning. Main character has no actual final goal or target, however it has general missions and random (or not so random) encounters. The gameplay loop is something along this lines:

- Receive bounty mission in missives / from notice board / from npc.
- Start planning and investigating about the general location and traits of
  outlaw.
- Manage resources and needs of character.
- Seek plan and destroy / capture target, loot / capture / free outpost.

This is the general route of character, most noticeable is full freedom and realism in the way mission can be finished: you can free outlaw, you can kill or capture, you can get captured. Other really controversial and in the same time interesting idea is the absence of classical journal and map. I like when the gameplay is dynamic, and fast paced, however in such game like this it is more viable to make map and journal "up to player". Everything is up to you to remember and accomplish, there can be several quests and tasks that you can simply forget if do not pay attention and it is completely normal. Also map is not opened until you visit that location and without you scanner or equipment you lose all ability to locate yourself other then up to you senses.

### Mechanics, advancement

In order to complete your mission you can use several mechanics:

- **Obvious guns and blasters**
- **Paralyzing tech**: tranquilizers, shockers, lasso
- **Traps**: sand holes, quicksand machines, mimics
- **Grenades**: flash, smoke, molotov, cassette, mine, net, airstrike,
  fireflies grenade
- **Turrets / bots**: auto-target, taunt, kamikaze, remotely controlled
  fighter and eagle, shield-bots, fireflies, bugs

All of this items can be obtained from merchant and / or as a loot from the world. The important thing that i don't really like in games is consumables and items that you spend. I don't know why but I really don't like to spend stuff, and tend to left most consumables and items for a better times. Thus personally for me and for my likings it is important to make those thing accessible and valuable in the same time. You need to understand that by spending kamikaze bot on some lame enemies would make no sense, however using it against large group of stronger and harder challengers will make the profits that will pay off 2-3 times.

Also player will be able to obtain several abilities, by completing missions or by other gameplay related means. Simply put all skills that you can obtain through advancing will not be crucial to complete the game. There will be no such term as completing game, there will be stronger and more organized enemies which are just harder to deal with and less capable which are easier to capture and get the reward for. Thus your general route of advancing will lie through the more simple and chaotic enemies which are more stupid and have low AI to more capable, generally better equipped and stronger ones. Your own advancement will simply lie on your own equipment and resources and resources in turn will come from the prey you captured. All of this will not effect your story quest advancement at all and will just be the side effect for gamers which are interested in gameplay part of the game. In turn all of the story related stuff will not affect the gameplay and you won't need to complete several missions to unlock certain item that unlocks insane abilities and so on.

Simple ideas on the perks that can be obtained from enemies and world are:

- Item that increases the capacity of bots under control
- Map of the area
- Lie detector (to certain degree)
- Recipe for molotov)
- Updated AI operating system for bots
- Sandstorm scanner
- Stealth cloak

It is really important to balance those items well, hide them behind strong enemy bands, deep cavern monsters and other gameplay-wise interesting and complicated enemies.

### NPC says no lies

Notable thing I dislike in games is hyperbolization of enemy powers from npc's. Often they just say some misinformation or plain simple lore, without more details and information about mission. I want the NPC to be the source of truth (or lies) that effectively crafts your journal and targets. If some buddy says that this or that outlaw band is dangerous they really mean it and in your current situation it is dangerous to go and deal with them, however based on level of a player and their abilities npc can notice that "Oh they are dangerous but judging by your looks you are capable to deal with them" and so on and so forth. Generally that means game will give you simple hint on whether you are ready or not to ambush the band.

### Loneliness, rewards, fears

The Long Dark has this really nice feeling of danger, of inevitability, I really want this game to have similar vibe. There needs to be minimum information from interface and other outer sources to make it happen. You have to be lonely one against the world, you have to fight. When you accomplish something it is really rewarding, looting some higher level enemy getting their equipment, doesn't just makes you stronger it makes you more **capable**. You can loot map of a location, some tool that can unlock more interesting locations, some skill point which are impossible to obtain just from playing and advancing. You can upgrade your helper robots, you can find new modification for yourself.

Sometimes in games you can emerge yourself really deep into the world and atmosphere so that you really can feel some fears and inevitabilities that may player feel. For example in Far Cry 3 there is starting mission where you get captured. First time I played this game and listened to Vaas from cage, that was really magical. When we escaped from outpost and did all the steals stuff, nevertheless it was just the tutorial still it felt really emerging. In Fears To Fathom there are also several occasions where the atmosphere just strikes, sometimes it is just plain horror, but sometimes it makes you feel several emotions at once it is both fascination and fear, and it's really what i wish to incorporate in this games missions.

## Plot and lore

Plot of the game is not yet designed, however I have several ideas which could put up a baseline for the plot and plot related content. Firstly, let's remind where are we. We are at a lonely planet near two suns, the lands are desolated, there are couple large cities and bunch of small towns, near big cities there are some artificial fields and greenhouses which provides food, however it is obvious that it's not enough. The main twist of all of this is that the two suns which are located further away relatively to our Earth, are about to collapse, and form a new star. The government of a planet realises it and tries to hide details from people.

The story and lore of the planet are quite blurry and hidden behind the recent several thousand years. Everything that was happening before then is hidden from average folk and only government of several cities dig that deep into the slate ground of a planet to realise that other civilizations also occurred here before and left a lot of vital information towards the solution of two suns collapse.

## Show don't tell

That's exactly where main protagonist can fit really well. From a gameplay perspective, there will be several cavern systems which are guarded by governmental elite officers and mercenaries. Technically it would be extremely hard missions and thus requires the player to advance on the skills and equipment to actually get into that cavern systems. The main secrets and interesting trinkets will be located deeper in the caves. First and most important is the way the lore will actually be delivered to our protagonist. I don't really like the cutscenes, long text walls, frescos, unskippable dialogues and so on, that's why my idea is to use in game scenes where player can actually play as previous generations and see the scene from first point perspective, also I really like point cloud technique to show some holographic black and white scenes. In combination it could be really good gameplay concept.

First you enter the cave, you deal with the mercenaries, you dig deeper, find entrance to ancient temple underground, find linking port to see the past, see the beginning of a scene in a point cloud, enter the scene as a protagonist and receive information and lore by being teleported to the past. Similar technique is used in Far Cry 4 when the player gets teleported to Shangri-La and move around as completely different person, with different gameplay mechanics and equipment. (For me personally it was quite a bit of a shock realising that devs really went that far and compressed full fledged game into the game. Only then I realised that it was actually a preface for their next game Far Cry Primal). The main goal of this approach is not to overload the player with information and other hard to grasp things instead we give the player the opportunity to interact and explore different world which is filled with lore and story, and will help to unravel the answers to the main problem - the two suns collision. Main concept behind all of this is to use the technique called "show don't tell", most of the scene will be like a silent movie, it will show the scenes, show the solutions, show actions, show characters, the dialogue and text should be minimized or even completely removed, probably only voiced lines and subtitles will be preserved. Also this caverns will not require player to pass them one by one in relative order, in contrary, it will be possible advance in random order and even skip some. It's up to player if they decide to take their time and find out about lore, or just simply chill in game and have fun playing or enjoying atmosphere.

## Quasi-lore

Other than this giant underground cavern systems practically filled with lore, there will be smaller locations under and above the ground which will show the architecture and art of ancient civilizations. Just as in real world, you won't understand the meaning or purpose of this things however it will match with once found underground. Also there will be not one but several types of art and structures which will hint on different civilizations on the planet existing hand in hand. Main idea of this buildings is to serve the hideout places for outlaw bands and the main field of war for the player. It will not mean anything to the player until they actually start the story investigations. Similar to Minecraft where you simply don't have any point on what is happening in the world, who are pillagers, villagers, enderman and ender dragon, why there is a zombies, why there is a creeper wall paintings in desert temples and so on. I really like this approach and want to incorporate similar techniques n this games.

## Soundtrack and sound design

### Atmosphere

Yet again The Long Dark is one of the best in creating the sound atmosphere. There is simple yet powerful techniques when certain situations just underlined using the sound design. When you enter or exit cave, when the stamina is low, when you meet sunrise or sunset, when you meet a wolf or a bear. I really like this approach, there is a lot of melodic soundtracks still the most memorable situations I have involves the soundtrack that contains simple riff of sound effect. It's just this simple and sudden sound effects and melodic slicks that makes the situation marvelous.

In this game I really want to incorporate quite similar but more advanced system. The idea is to write simple and memorable effects and melodies, then mix them up in one giant track using both AI and manual techniques. Then in game the soundtrack will be generated on the go based on the parameters collected from the current situation you're in. Simply put each and every effect will be somehow different and yet resemble basic melody and idea. The key difference from classic approach is the variability and non intrusiveness. When in classic games (e.g. Witcher, The Elder Scrolls, Heroes of Might and Magic, Genshin Impact) the combat starts you always hear the same 3-10 melodies, and even if they are written extraordinarily good (as in all of listed above), it still can get pretty boring after 1-10 thousand of battles, especially with simple scripts of `entering` and `exiting` hostile areas or battles. My approach is to generate simple sounds and effects that just underline the vitality of the situation and everything else leave to the imagination.

Imagine hearing simple powerful melodies as you walk by the sand mountain and spot enemy camp, as you stamina falls low and you realize there is nothing left to eat, when you meet new dawn, when the sandstorm strikes. That makes the situation 10 times more epic, and it is not unimaginably hard to implement. The basic idea is to reference areas in memory where parameters interesting for the soundtrack engine are located, read and analyze the situation (resource numbers, coordinates and locations, hostile mobs nearby etc.) and based on this values read noisily generated index from soundtrack mix. After that comes complicated part which is harder to implement but it is still possible, we need to decide how to mix in the track we got so that it plays in a compositional beginning and ending. The easiest solution is to simply fade in and out this sounds, however i cannot say that this is the most beautiful technique I've ever heard.

### Sound design

Another extremely high quality technique is one used in Red Dead Redemption 2. There is no over the top ideas or something unimaginably interesting, however the real feature lies in a quality of sound design. Every horse breath, every clack, every tree leaf fall, everything is deep, everything has a weight to it. It's like the music playing from a powerful dynamics from far away. You hear the bass itself. Imagine the same weight but in sounds from nature, from city, from your own and others breath.

I really like sound design and approach of Fallout and Bioshock series. They give you real world old songs from 20-40s and add up with own atomic and steampunk style. Another example is Far Cry 5 and Far Cry New Dawn. In both games there are outposts which play licensed music that has some impact on the actual lore of the game and the situation itself. This fashion of playing related to the outpost music started back from the Far Cry 3 (and maybe even earlier) but the idea of playing it right at the outpost with effects of bass and mumble over it started from the fifth game. The basic idea is to layer several EQ effects over the track and apply spacial sound. Then depending on the distance to the source change appropriate effect to the lower or higher values and fade in or fade out if it is really far or the weather changes and sound of wind layers over it. There are several build in techniques in the game engines already and couple of really high quality C libraries.

### Tech, city, TV/radio sounds, effects

Another interesting idea is to use sound recordings of television and radio programmes and shows similar to what the Grand Theft Auto series does. Record bunch of related stuff to the game lore and situation in the game world, hire several voice actors that are ready to discuss all those topics just like in real world podcasts (or AI generate all of those media) and play those recordings between licensed tracks in the radio. It is really fascinating how "real" the radio and soundtrack became after this technique. It is not necessary to use it abusively everywhere, we can sprinkle lots of voiced programmes among the radio songs, or we can make the dedicated radio that plays podcasts. The downside of this method is actual filling of the programmes. The topics could vary from the general lore situation down to the local player decisions and the impact it had on the world. It is really complicated to generate or prerecord all of the possible topics, and thus it can be really costly.

The main player throughout the gameplay can get newer equipment and newer bots, so it also could be really nice to add voice of the bots and on-board computer. The main target is to make this systems non-intrusive and optional. With that said receiving notification about low hp with voice on the background as the part of the audio system without too much intimidation could probably be nice and more appropriate in this kind of game even instead of UI elements. Also audio voices of your system and bots may be changeable and it would be nice feature to get the voice of any npc, record it and use it with your bot.

## Interface

### HUD

Oh interface dear interface. There are a countless ways of placing and designing HUD elements. Some might prefer more "gamish", more fantasy style looks, some might prefer simplicity. Personally, I really like interfaces where most of the time you just look into the camera and nothing else. You immersed into rendering and sound design, you should not really care about all of the overlay that just add noise. That's why i really like simple UI's where there's a simple dot in the middle of the screen when you aim, and your stats values is just simple rounded lines that show up only when they change or when they are important. Some specific menus like bot controls, favorite menu, linear or polar compass can also be implemented in simplest form possible, mono colored and showed only when important. Also it is crucial for the game to have an ability to disable and configure interface to your liking, thus simple settings system with visible overlay should be implemented. Really good examples of interface and it's configurability can be found in Far Cry series and in moded Skyrim (duh, mods in question are Dear Diary, SkyHUD, SkyUI and ImmersiveHUD, Convenient Dialogue UI).

### Menus

The interface logically can be split into two parts: HUD and menus, we've already covered HUD part - it's all that appears on your screen while you're actively playing, menus on the other hand designed to be used while you're planning your next move, manage inventory, enter and exit the game. One really important thing I found about all the menus is that it all can be compressed down to more simple and more convenient controls methods. That is crucial to give ability for player to configure and use all menus only with their keyboard bindings, particularly with the bindings that are easily accessible with only ONE hand (whichever hand you use to walk, most of the times it's left one with fingers placed onto `A` `W` `S` `D` keys). In my case it is really convenient to be able to move around menus using same keys I use to walk, and do other context actions with keys located around them. With addition of gamepad support it is way easier to comprehend the problem and use the very same code of menu actions for the keyboard and mouse players.

Speaking of the actual interface design it should be simple, monochrome and rounded. I know that it is a matter of taste, however I don't want to overcomplicate things in this chapter (see [Modding](#modding)). The key features I find really important is there should be no doodles and deep shadows in the interface and general style of the menus must be unified and generalized throughout all the game. If one menu gives an ability to repeat action other must too, if one menu has simple black background every other must too. To make a menu more visible in front of background render, I prefer to use mixture of simple Gaussian blur with an addition of semi-transparent dark overlay. The example of good UI interactions is in moded Skyrim (SkyUI) you can use your keys easily switch between menus, sort, search and all of this can be achieved with simple keybinding presses. The example of bad design decisions on the other hand can be found in Genshin Impact where most of the times you are forced to use your mouse, to aim and press the damn button, despite the fact that the game itself fully supports gamepad and have all the keybindings for it.

## Controls

First thing first: everything should be configurable. That is the rule of thumb, if your game has an action which cannot be assigned to keybinding it is already bad trait.

Next is context. One key should serve more than one purpose in different contexts, it is obvious thing but sometimes devs tend to forget that (Sea of Thieves). Red Dead Redemption show really good example of context keybinding usage and its variability, the only thing that I don't really like is the need to hold the button to be able to perform certain actions (e.g. horse management and inventory). We should leverage the keyboard and mouse abilities and add more keybindings for actions like: using items, calling bots, managing party and so on, it is really not that hard to remember couple combinations especially if they are unified and widely used. Also there will be no pause in a game menus (except system, book UI and console) so it is crucial to be able to quickly swap items, use consumable, scan surroundings or call for bots. In order to balance the amount of buttons on keyboard vs gamepad the context and modal system must be implemented. And that's where the HUD pop up menus and wheels are really useful.

## Small details and general atmosphere

## Notes to expand

- Point cloud, weighted Voronoi stippling, dithering (some cyberspace lore stuff)
- Cooperative, multiplayer, balancing of players attributes and attributes of enemies
