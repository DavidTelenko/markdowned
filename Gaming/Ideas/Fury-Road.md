The idea is to create a replayable game where the environment and roles are
dynamic. Here's a clean breakdown of the concept:

1. **Gameplay Overview**:

   - The game centers on a recurring journey along a vast, winding, and
     branching roadâ€”essentially a massive track.
   - Players take on one of four roles: Sniper, Bomber, Driver, or Assault
     Specialist.
   - Each role has distinct mechanics and responsibilities.

2. **Enhanced Interaction**:

   - Actions are more complex than standard controls. For instance, reloading a
     weapon involves multiple steps: pulling out the magazine, inserting it, and
     chambering the round, adding a layer of immersion.

3. **Enemies and Waves**:

   - Endless waves of enemies dynamically adapt to the situation.
   - Enemies attempt to interact with or attack a convoy (e.g., a large truck),
     and the team must fend them off.

4. **End Goal**:

   - The objective is to reach a safe zone where the team unloads cargo or
     finishes the mission.

5. **Customizability**:
   - The game can scale in complexity. It could be streamlined or expanded into
     features like:
     - **Open-world mechanics**.
     - A "Mad Max"-style universe with more chaos and freedom.

This framework allows for flexibility, making the game as simple or intricate
as desired while maintaining a core replayable experience.

Another idea is to create a recurring gameplay around same four characters, but
give a player possibility to play as every character each time reaching the end
with one each more at a time. So e.g first you play as a Driver and drive to
the end target. Then you switch to Sniper, and have to overcome the mistakes
you made while driving, and so on.
