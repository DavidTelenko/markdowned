# General concept

I've been thinking about a game with a lot of emphasis on the number three, and here's the concept:

- There are three main biomes: desert, frozen biome, and forest.
- Between them, there are transitional biomes: taiga, ocean, dried-up sea, swamp, etc. These are smaller.
- You spawn randomly in one of them. You can play in co-op or PvP mode. In co-op, you either spawn together or in different main biomes.
- There are three classes: warrior, mage, bandit.
- Between these classes, there are hybrid classes: paladin, illusionist, berserker.
- Each class has mechanics corresponding to the biome where you spawned: in the frozen biome, the warrior is a barbarian, the mage uses ice, in the desert there's a fireball-throwing guy, a golden warrior, etc.
- Each of the three biomes has a boss: dragon, golem, dendroid.
- When playing solo in the desert, for example, your goal is to defeat the dendroid from the forest.
- In co-op mode, your goal is the same as in solo, but it's more challenging.
- In PvP mode, the goal is to defeat players from other biomes.
