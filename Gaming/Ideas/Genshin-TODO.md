# Genshin TODO

List of tasks to submit to genshin survey.

- Add an ability to use Radiant Spincrystals without going to tea pot
- Not only show an amount of collected item, but also the amount of currently
  possessed ones. So for example if you collect one flower it will show +1 and 32
  total in inventory.
- Add an ability to skip filler dialogues.
- Add notifications for Parametric Transformer
- Add bank of boss drops, meaning if I don't want to farm currently present
  bosses in world, and want to wait for a newer boss, i can collect up to certain
  amount of tries instead of waiting when new boss comes out.
- More locations with artifacts in game. Just like with Obsidian fragments.
  Maybe add some guaranteed afixes for this kind of artifacts.
- Add permanent hide'n'seek mini game.
- Make restart button for a Crystalfly Trap, so that it would just place it in
  the same place with same materials as a fuel.
