# Generative

This is the compilation of ideas about generative and procedural algorithms used in gaming.

- Use [WFC](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFYMOzoSDNE) at global scale to create generally random maps
- Locally use premade models and combined models to create random locations inside wfc grid
- Generate crossfading locations between bioms
- Premade structures differ on differenct bioms and in cross regions
- Combine large wfc grids into open world
- Generate trees (using ebnf grammar) and rocks using noise
- Generate clouds using 3d noise combined with shaders
- Quests and lore generation based on static rules using gpt or similar technique
