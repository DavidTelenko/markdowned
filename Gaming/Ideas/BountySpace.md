# General ideas on game

Here I try to describe my bundled ideas about the game I have in mind, and
general ideas that aims to make it unique and interesting)

## General setting and atmosphere

Lonely deserted planet. Two suns in the sky. Hot, dunes and sand. World is full
of naturally occurring disasters: tornadoes, sand storms. Several small
western-like towns, which gives sense of loneliness and abandonment. Two-five
large cyberpunk cities that concentrate all civilization in planet. Rich
trading and economic system. Clear distinction in resource supply and demand.
Outlaws bands and rich multileveled crime-world. Setting generally can be
described as mixture between Mad Max, Fallout, Dune, Cyberpunk, Red Dead
Redemption, Mandalorian series. We take desert from Duna and Mad Max, large
cities similar to what Cyberpunk and Fallout have spice it up with villages
similar to Red Dead Redemption but in more cyber fashion like in Mandalorian
series.

## Main character

You play as a lonely bounty hunter, you seek, plan and capture criminals. You
have basic needs similar to what The Long Dark has but it's easier to maintain
and control the levels because of longer timings. You are not completely human
with modified parts but you tend to stay humane enough to not cause the Ship of
Perseus dilemma. You are a real person not an empty shell with silent dialogue
options (similar to Witcher). You have several robots helpers and you can play
as them (More of a gameplay feature). Your story lies rather on a trivial more
simple side of narrative. You are generated human, after the second riot for
the rights of intellectual creatures, human generation continued but with more
humane rules and freedoms. Still the attitude of originals and the general
public opinions causes a lot of conflicts and misunderstandings. You set
yourself a target to earn a right to be accepted in society and do good. You
tend to shaken this opinion quite often.

Conceptually this character is similar to Witcher and Mandalorian. Some unique
features would probably include less power and abilities with more thought
process and planning. You are not the most capable nor talented however you
have a lot of experience and knowledge. You a free to choose your own path and
do completely different from an archetype initially built into the character.
  You can became merchant and earn money, you can became criminal, rob and
  kill, you can integrate into society of a big cities, you can live solitary
  life.

## Gameplay

### General

The gameplay is basically split between visual narrative and tactics /
planning. Main character has no actual final goal or target, however it has
general missions and random (or not so random) encounters. The gameplay loop is
something along this lines:

  - Receive bounty mission in missives / from notice board / from npc.
  - Start planning and investigating about the general location and traits of
    outlaw.
  - Manage resources and needs of character.
  - Seek plan and destroy / capture target, loot / capture / free outpost.

This is the general route of character, most noticeable is full freedom and
realism in the way mission can be finished: you can free outlaw, you can kill
or capture, you can get captured. Other really controversial and in the same
time interesting idea is the absence of classical journal and map. I like when
the gameplay is dynamic, and fast paced, however in such game like this it is
more viable to make map and journal "up to player". Everything is up to you to
remember and accomplish, there can be several quests and tasks that you can
simply forget if do not pay attention and it is completely normal. Also map is
not opened until you visit that location and without you scanner or equipment
you lose all ability to locate yourself other then up to you senses.

### Mechanics, advancement

In order to complete your mission you can use several mechanics:
  - **Obvious guns and blasters**
  - **Paralyzing tech**: tranquilizers, shockers, lasso
  - **Traps**: sand holes, quicksand machines, mimics
  - **Grenades**: flash, smoke, molotov, cassette, mine, net, airstrike,
    fireflies grenade
  - **Turrets / bots**: auto-target, taunt, kamikaze, remotely controlled
    fighter and eagle, shield-bots, fireflies, bugs

All of this items can be obtained from merchant and / or as a loot from the
world. The important thing that i don't really like in games is consumables and
items that you spend. I don't know why but I really don't like to spend stuff,
and tend to left most consumables and items for a better times. Thus personally
for me and for my likings it is important to make those thing accessible and
valuable in the same time. You need to understand that by spending kamikaze
bot on some lame enemies would make no sense, however using it against large
group of stronger and harder challengers will make the profits that will pay
off 2-3 times.

Also player will be able to obtain several abilities, by completing missions or
by other gameplay related means. Simply put all skills that you can obtain
through advancing will not be crucial to complete the game. There will be no
such term as completing game, there will be stronger and more organized enemies
which are just harder to deal with and less capable which are easier to capture
and get the reward for. Thus your general route of advancing will lie through
the more simple and chaotic enemies which are more stupid and have low AI to
more capable, generally better equipped and stronger ones. Your own advancement
will simply lie on your own equipment and resources and resources in turn will
come from the prey you captured. All of this will not effect your story quest
advancement at all and will just be the side effect for gamers which are
interested in gameplay part of the game. In turn all of the story related stuff
will not affect the gameplay and you won't need to complete several missions to
unlock certain item that unlocks insane abilities and so on.

Simple ideas on the perks that can be obtained from enemies and world are:
  - Item that increases the capacity of bots under control
  - Map of the area
  - Lie detector (to certain degree)
  - Recipe for molotov)
  - Updated AI operating system for bots
  - Sandstorm scanner
  - Stealth cloak

It is really important to balance those items well, hide them behind strong
enemy bands, deep cavern monsters and other gameplay-wise interesting and
complicated enemies.

### NPC says no lies

Notable thing I dislike in games is hyperbolization of enemy powers from npc's.
Often they just say some misinformation or plain simple lore, without more
details and information about mission. I want the NPC to be the source of truth
(or lies) that effectively crafts your journal and targets. If some buddy says
that this or that outlaw band is dangerous they really mean it and in your
current situation it is dangerous to go and deal with them, however based on
level of a player and their abilities npc can notice that "Oh they are
dangerous but judging by your looks you are capable to deal with them" and so
on and so forth. Generally that means game will give you simple hint on whether
you are ready or not to ambush the band.

### Loneliness, rewards, fears

The Long Dark has this really nice feeling of danger, of inevitability, I
really want this game to have similar vibe. There needs to be minimum
information from interface and other outer sources to make it happen. You have
to be lonely one against the world, you have to fight. When you accomplish
something it is really rewarding, looting some higher level enemy getting their
equipment, doesn't just makes you stronger it makes you more **capable**. You
can loot map of a location, some tool that can unlock more interesting
locations, some skill point which are impossible to obtain just from playing
and advancing. You can upgrade your helper robots, you can find new
modification for yourself.

Sometimes in games you can emerge yourself really deep into the world and
atmosphere so that you really can feel some fears and inevitabilities that may
player feel. For example in Far Cry 3 there is starting mission where you get
captured. First time I played this game and listened to Vaas from cage, that
was really magical. When we escaped from outpost and did all the steals stuff,
nevertheless it was just the tutorial still it felt really emerging. In Fears
To Fathom there are also several occasions where the atmosphere just strikes,
sometimes it is just plain horror, but sometimes it makes you feel several
emotions at once it is both fascination and fear, and it's really what i wish
to incorporate in this games missions.

## Plot and lore

## Show don't tell, quasi-lore

## Soundtrack and sound design

### Atmosphere

Yet again The Long Dark is one of the best in creating the sound atmosphere.
There is simple yet powerful techniques when certain situations just underlined
using the sound design. When you enter or exit cave, when the stamina is low,
when you meet sunrise or sunset, when you meet a wolf or a bear. I really like
this approach, there is a lot of melodic soundtracks still the most memorable
situations I have involves the soundtrack that contains simple riff of sound
effect. It's just this simple and sudden sound effects and melodic slicks that
makes the situation marvelous.

In this game I really want to incorporate quite similar but more advanced
system. The idea is to write simple and memorable effects and melodies, then
mix them up in one giant track using both AI and manual techniques. Then in
game the soundtrack will be generated on the go based on the parameters
collected from the current situation you're in. Simply put each and every
effect will be somehow different and yet resemble basic melody and idea. The
key difference from classic approach is the variability and non intrusiveness.
When in classic games (e.g. Witcher, The Elder Scrolls, Heroes of Might and
Magic, Genshin Impact) the combat starts you always hear the same 3-10
melodies, and even if they are written extraordinarily good (as in all of
listed above), it still can get pretty boring after 1-10 thousand of battles,
especially with simple scripts of `entering` and `exiting` hostile areas or
battles. My approach is to generate simple sounds and effects that just
underline the vitality of the situation and everything else leave to the
imagination.

Imagine hearing simple powerful melodies as you walk by the sand mountain and
spot enemy camp, as you stamina falls low and you realize there is nothing left
to eat, when you meet new dawn, when the sandstorm strikes. That makes the
situation 10 times more epic, and it is not unimaginably hard to implement. The
basic idea is to reference areas in memory where parameters interesting for the
soundtrack engine are located, read and analyze the situation (resource
numbers, coordinates and locations, hostile mobs nearby etc.) and based on this
values read noisily generated index from soundtrack mix. After that comes
complicated part which is harder to implement but it is still possible, we need
to decide how to mix in the track we got so that it plays in a compositional
beginning and ending. The easiest solution is to simply fade in and out this
sounds, however i cannot say that this is the most beautiful technique I've
ever heard.

### Sound design

Another extremely high quality technique is one used in Red Dead Redemption 2.
There is no over the top ideas or something unimaginably interesting, however
the real feature lies in a quality of sound design. Every horse breath, every
clack, every tree leaf fall, everything is deep, everything has a weight to it.
It's like the music playing from a powerful dynamics from far away. You hear
the bass itself. Imagine the same weight but in sounds from nature, from city,
from your own and others breath.

I really like sound design and approach of Fallout and Bioshock series. They
give you real world old songs from 20-40s and add up with own atomic and
steampunk style. Another example is Far Cry 5 and Far Cry New Dawn. In both
games there are outposts which play licensed music that has some impact on the
actual lore of the game and the situation itself. This fashion of playing
related to the outpost music started back from the Far Cry 3 (and maybe even
earlier) but the idea of playing it right at the outpost with effects of bass
and mumble over it started from the fifth game. The basic idea is to layer
several EQ effects over the track and apply spacial sound. Then depending on
the distance to the source change appropriate effect to the lower or higher
values and fade in or fade out if it is really far or the weather changes and
sound of wind layers over it. There are several build in techniques in the game
engines already and couple of really high quality C libraries.

### Tech, city, TV/radio sounds, effects

Another interesting idea is to use sound recordings of television and radio
programmes and shows similar to what the Grand Theft Auto series does. Record
bunch of related stuff to the game lore and situation in the game world, hire
several voice actors that are ready to discuss all those topics just like in
real world podcasts (or AI generate all of those media) and play those
recordings between licensed tracks in the radio. It is really fascinating how
"real" the radio and soundtrack became after this technique. It is not
necessary to use it abusively everywhere, we can sprinkle lots of voiced
programmes among the radio songs, or we can make the dedicated radio that plays
podcasts. The downside of this method is actual filling of the programmes. The
topics could vary from the general lore situation down to the local player
decisions and the impact it had on the world. It is really complicated to
generate or prerecord all of the possible topics, and thus it can be really
costly.

The main player throughout the gameplay can get newer equipment and newer bots,
so it also could be really nice to add voice of the bots and on-board computer.
The main target is to make this systems non-intrusive and optional. With that
said receiving notification about low hp with voice on the background as the
part of the audio system without too much intimidation could probably be nice
and more appropriate in this kind of game even instead of UI elements. Also
audio voices of your system and bots may be changeable and it would be nice
feature to get the voice of any npc, record it and use it with your bot. 

## Interface

### HUD

Oh interface dear interface. There are a countless ways of placing and
designing HUD elements. Some might prefer more "gamish", more fantasy style
looks, some might prefer simplicity. Personally, I really like interfaces where
most of the time you just look into the camera and nothing else. You immersed
into rendering and sound design, you should not really care about all of the
overlay that just add noise. That's why i really like simple UI's where there's
a simple dot in the middle of the screen when you aim, and your stats values is
just simple rounded lines that show up only when they change or when they are
important. Some specific menus like bot controls, favorite menu, linear or
polar compass can also be implemented in simplest form possible, mono colored
and showed only when important. Also it is crucial for the game to have an
ability to disable and configure interface to your liking, thus simple settings
system with visible overlay should be implemented. Really good examples of
interface and it's configurability can be found in Far Cry series and in moded
Skyrim (duh, mods in question are Dear Diary, SkyHUD, SkyUI and ImmersiveHUD,
Convenient Dialogue UI).

### Menus

The interface logically can be split into two parts: HUD and menus, we've
already covered HUD part - it's all that appears on your screen while you're
actively playing, menus on the other hand designed to be used while you're
planning your next move, manage inventory, enter and exit the game. One really
important thing I found about all the menus is that it all can be compressed
down to more simple and more convenient controls methods. That is crucial to
give ability for player to configure and use all menus only with their keyboard
bindings, particularly with the bindings that are easily accessible with only
ONE hand (whichever hand you use to walk, most of the times it's left one with
fingers placed onto `A` `W` `S` `D` keys). In my case it is really convenient
to be able to move around menus using same keys I use to walk, and do other
context actions with keys located around them. With addition of gamepad support
it is way easier to comprehend the problem and use the very same code of menu
actions for the keyboard and mouse players. 

Speaking of the actual interface design it should be simple, monochrome and
rounded. I know that it is a matter of taste, however I don't want to
overcomplicate things in this chapter (see [Modding](#modding)). The key
features I find really important is there should be no doodles and deep shadows
in the interface and general style of the menus must be unified and generalized
throughout all the game. If one menu gives an ability to repeat action other
must too, if one menu has simple black background every other must too. To make
a menu more visible in front of background render, I prefer to use mixture of
simple Gaussian blur with an addition of semi-transparent dark overlay. The
example of good UI interactions is in moded Skyrim (SkyUI) you can use your
keys easily switch between menus, sort, search and all of this can be achieved
with simple keybinding presses. The example of bad design decisions on the
other hand can be found in Genshin Impact where most of the times you are
forced to use your mouse, to aim and press the damn button, despite the fact
that the game itself fully supports gamepad and have all the keybindings for
it.

## Controls

First thing first: everything should be configurable. That is the rule of
thumb, if your game has an action which cannot be assigned to keybinding
it is already bad trait. 

Next is context. One key should serve more than one purpose in different
contexts, it is obvious thing but sometimes devs tend to forget that (Sea of
Thieves). Red Dead Redemption show really good example of context keybinding
usage and its variability, the only thing that I don't really like is the need
to hold the button to be able to perform certain actions (e.g. horse management
and inventory). We should leverage the keyboard and mouse abilities and add
more keybindings for actions like: using items, calling bots, managing party
and so on, it is really not that hard to remember couple combinations
especially if they are unified and widely used. Also there will be no pause in
a game menus (except system, book UI and console) so it is crucial to be able
to quickly swap items, use consumable, scan surroundings or call for bots. In
order to balance the amount of buttons on keyboard vs gamepad the context and
modal system must be implemented. And that's where the HUD pop up menus and
wheels are really useful.
