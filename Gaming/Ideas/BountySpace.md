# General ideas on game

Here I try to describe my bundled ideas about the game I have in mind, and
general ideas that aims to make it unique and interesting)

## General setting and atmosphere

Lonely deserted planet. Two suns in the sky. Hot, dunes and sand. World is full
of naturally occurring disasters: tornadoes, sand storms. Several small
western-like towns, which gives sense of loneliness and abandonment. Two-five
large cyberpunk cities that concentrate all civilization in planet. Rich
trading and economic system. Clear distinction in resource supply and demand.
Outlaws bands and rich multileveled crime-world. Setting generally can be
described as mixture between Mad Max, Fallout, Dune, Cyberpunk, Red Dead
Redemption, Mandalorian series. We take desert from Duna and Mad Max, large
cities similar to what Cyberpunk and Fallout have spice it up with villages
similar to Red Dead Redemption but in more cyber fashion like in Mandalorian
series.

## Main character

You play as a lonely bounty hunter, you seek, plan and capture criminals. You
have basic needs similar to what The Long Dark has but it's easier to maintain
and control the levels because of longer timings. You are not completely human
with modified parts but you tend to stay humane enough to not cause the Ship of
Perseus dilemma. You are a real person not an empty shell with silent dialogue
options (similar to Witcher). You have several robots helpers and you can play
as them (More of a gameplay feature). Your story lies rather on a trivial more
simple side of narrative. You are generated human, after the second riot for
the rights of intellectual creatures, human generation continued but with more
humane rules and freedoms. Still the attitude of originals and the general
public opinions causes a lot of conflicts and misunderstandings. You set
yourself a target to earn a right to be accepted in society and do good. You
tend to shaken this opinion quite often.

Conceptually this character is similar to Witcher and Mandalorian. Some unique
features would probably include less power and abilities with more thought
process and planning. You are not the most capable nor talented however you
have a lot of experience and knowledge. You a free to choose your own path and
do completely different from an archetype initially built into the character.
You can became merchant and earn money, you can became criminal, rob and kill,
you can integrate into society of a big cities, you can live solitary life.

## Gameplay

The gameplay is basically split between visual narrative and tactics / planning.
