# General ideas on game

Here I try to describe my bundled ideas about the game I have in mind, and
general (maybe unique) ideas that aims to make it unique)

## General setting and atmosphere

Lonely deserted planet. Two suns in the sky. Hot, dunes and sand. World is full
of naturally occurring disasters: tornadoes, sand storms. Several small
western-like towns, which gives sense of loneliness and abandonment. Two-five
large cyberpunk cities that concentrate all civilization in planet. Rich
trading and economic system. Clear distinction in resource supply and demand.
Outlaws bands and rich multileveled crime-world. Setting generally can be
described as mixture between Mad Max, Fallout, Dune, Cyberpunk, Red Dead
Redemption, Mandalorian series. We take desert from Duna and Mad Max, large
cities similar to what Cyberpunk and Fallout have spice it up with villages
similar to Red Dead Redemption but in more cyber fashion like in Mandalorian
series.
