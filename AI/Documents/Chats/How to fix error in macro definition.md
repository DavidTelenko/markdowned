I have the following macro to create a struct:

```c
#define CREATE_MATRIX(dtype, rows, cols, data) { \
    .rows = rows,                                \
    .cols = cols,                                \
    .dtype = sizeof(dtype),                      \
    .data = (void* const)data,                   \
}
```

The structure looks like this:

```c
typedef struct {
    size_t rows;
    size_t cols;
    size_t dtype;
    void* const data;
} matrix2;
```

Then i use this macro to create a struct object like this:

```c
const matrix2 m = CREATE_MATRIX(float, 5, 6, &data);
```

The error i receive is the following:

```
<source>: In function 'main':
<source>:80:44: error: expected identifier before numeric constant
   80 |     const matrix2 m = CREATE_MATRIX(float, 5, 6, &data);

      |
```

How to fix this?

The error you are encountering is due to the fact that you are using reserved keywords (`rows` and `cols`) as arguments in your macro definition. To fix this issue, you can modify your macro to use different argument names. Here's an updated version of your macro:

```c
#define CREATE_MATRIX(dtype, numRows, numCols, data) { \
    .rows = numRows,                                \
    .cols = numCols,                                \
    .dtype = sizeof(dtype),                         \
    .data = (void* const)data,                       \
}
```

With this modification, you can now use the macro to create a struct object without any errors:

```c
const matrix2 m = CREATE_MATRIX(float, 5, 6, &data);
```

Note that I changed the argument names from `rows` and `cols` to `numRows` and `numCols` respectively to avoid conflicts with reserved keywords.

Thanks, for your development i will just mention that the problem wasn't entirely because of `rows` and `cols` was a reserved keywords, but rather it was because the struct has the same fields. So to fix the error i had to change every parameter name in macro to be different from fields names.

You're correct, I apologize for the confusion. The issue was indeed caused by the macro parameters having the same names as the struct fields. To avoid conflicts, it is necessary to use different names for the macro parameters. Thank you for pointing that out.
