Hidden beneath, a world unseen
A jungle grows, with vines so green
Deeper still, the roots entwine
A secret place, untouched by time

The creatures here, they slither and crawl
Their eerie calls, an ancient drawl
Mossy walls, surround this land
A lush escape, from human hand

But beware, as you venture below
For dangers lurk, in the soil they grow
Take care, tread softly, lest you disturb
This precious world, of which we preserve.
