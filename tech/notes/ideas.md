# Just a wisdom

- Design everything as a library, add an entry point to it later!

# Ideas for the productivity in OS (design for desktop environment)

- Sidebar with master search
- Minimalistic interface with all settings and options enclosed in one master
  search side menu
- Different symbols mean search in different places
- Button to select places where to search (for simple users)
- Plugins in the separate side menu (card menu) with miniature apps heat
  buttons (e.g discord mute unmute, spotify play, notion, clock, calendar,
  chatgpt, telegram, etc.)
- Nix inspired single file for all plugins backup on change
- (whole system probably fedora or nix based)
- Desktop spaces
- Script visual editor with nodes like in unreal engine
- Frequently used options like wifi, bluetooth, sound, night light, mobile hot
  spot etc.
- Integrated calendar with selected account
- Based configuration sync with cloud (with selective package syncing)
- File converter everything to everything in sidebar master search
- AI summarizer, translator.
- Custom model for AI from internet.

# Syncing stuff ideas

- full sync of configs
- sync of images/large files
- sync of package lists
- add git repo to the configs folder and remap hardcoded configs

# Interactive 3D AR Map

- Scan environment height map
- Perform photogrammetry
- Make cooperative mode
- Plan vacations
- 3D model on table

# Nvim plugin for ai

- Separate permanent buffer (similar to oil/quicker)
- Input text just as like in a file
- Special textobject to select last "prompt"
- Send to something like tgpt
- Receive reply and stream that below into the buffer

# Custom editor

- Terminal emulator by itself
- Not editor in terminal, terminal in editor
- Multiplexing
- LSP, DAP, TreeSitter, MCP
- Vim based motions + extended motions (based on nvim plugins (textobj, surround))
- Object files plugins (no runtime)
- Tabs, splits
- Built-in fuzzy finder
- Object files modules (toggle-able)
- Maybe [helpful](https://github.com/helix-editor/helix)

# Random project ideas

- Rewind by the beat
- Telegram but for local network
- Plugin system
- Support OS system (plugin based)
- Sessionizer for windows terminal (probably involves tinkering with wt github
  repo)
- Mobile torrent tracker viewer
- Sending dynamic linking libs, over TCP (QUIC) and executing them on the fly
  (rpc on steroids?)
- Hooking into AST of some lang, generating source code with source code,
  injecting source code into source code.
  [see](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FFgvV0sA3kU)
- Different system level indexing types based on a metatags of a directories
  and files (to implement something like virtual filtering and aggregations)
- Pipe based loader (download from one source on desktop, send this data down
  to mobile phone in local network)
- EGS store client
- YouTube view manager: watch time, topics, currently watching
- Plugin for telegram for vim like keymaps
- Similar to [spotify bar](https://github.com/Debuggingss/SpotifyWidget) status
  bar but show all media that currently playing
- YouTube / General video processing plugin that allows to analyze video with
  AI and produce array of timestamps for navigation.
- Simple AI plugin for nvim [hint](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HlfjpstqXwE)
- Simple rust based vim-like text editor
- Package manager
